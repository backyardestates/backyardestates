                the information in our system. These verification efforts
                require us to ask you to provide information so that we can
                match it with information you have previously provided us. For
                instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may
                ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
                information you provide with the information we already have on
                file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g.
                phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may
                also use other verification methods as the circumstances

                from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, if we
                cannot verify your identity from the information already
                maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional
                information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for
                security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
                additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
