            <p>
                Building an ADU adds new functional square footage to your
                property. This is the most obvious value add, as viewed by
                current appraisal norms. You are also adding a rentable unit.
                Each of these factors contributes to an increase in appraised
                value of the home. The value add can vary depending on the
                location and appraiser but can provide significant benefit in
                the short term and long term.
