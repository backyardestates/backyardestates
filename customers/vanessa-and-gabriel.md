> &ldquo;I donâ€™t feel like we are customers; I feel like Backyard Estates is taking a vested interest in our family.&rdquo;

Gabriel and Vanessa, expecting their second child, teamed up with Gabriel's parents, Grandma and Grandpa, to make a strategic move that benefited everyone involved. Seeking closer proximity to their grandchildren, Gabriel's parents sold their home and, along with Gabriel and Vanessa, purchased a new property in a better community. The plan? Build an ADU to maintain independence for Grandma and Grandpa, while creating a larger support system for the growing family.

> &ldquo;We highly recommend Backyard Estates.&rdquo;
